# Link Private DNS Zones to Virtual Networks and Deploy Private DNS Zones to an Existing Resource Group

This deploys the module in a more advanced and rarer configuration.

It will deploy custom private DNS zones into an existing Resource Group and will also link each of the Private DNS Zones to the Virtual Networks provided via a Private DNS Zone Virtual Network Link.

Also tags are added to all resources created by the module.
